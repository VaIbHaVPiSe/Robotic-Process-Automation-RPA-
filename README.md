#Automation : it is a process that emalutes the human actions

2 tyes of automations:
1) attention 
(human intervention will be there in btw the process(bot))
eg : captcha
activity of Input Dialog 

2) unattended
(without any human intervetion)
eg : Business process, Orchestration..

Typical flow for developing a Bot:
1) Business Analyst will gather all the req from the client.
2) Architectt will analyze the system req for that particular process.
3) Architect & develop will analyse the comlexity level& time estimation of the process.
4) Testing it in UAT(User Acceptance Testing)
5)once uat is successful then that procss will be deployed into production.
6)We need too schedule the process using the orchestrator.

RPA(Robotics Process Automation):
  
  It is a process that emalutes the Software Program. That s/w prg we can dvp using any of the rpa tools like (ui path , automation anywhere)- competitors..in market, nividous,openbots, Intellibot, etc.

UiPath is Romaina based Company, established in 2005.

UiPath 3 major components are:
* Uipath studio : we will develop the automation.
* Uipath Orchestrator : will publish the project/process.
* Uipath Robot : will b ehelpful in establishing the connection btw Studio and Orchestrator

Difference btw RPA & AI/ML:

Automation : rule based and Repetitive (automation)
Intelligent Automation/ Hyper Automation: rpa+ai/ml (cognitive capabilities)
